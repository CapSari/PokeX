## Setup

To setup and run the project, run it
on [Android Studio Ladybug](https://developer.android.com/studio) or a newer Version

## Architecture

The PokeX uses modularization and MVVM architecture
[Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)


Below shows the modularization diagram that is followed on PokeX

### App Module

The app module, depends on two modules `:features:minipokedex` and `:core:theme`.The code module 
contains the theming while feature are in feature module

### Feature Module

The feature modules, one feature of the app - minipokedex (list of Pokémon and the details).This can be tested in isolation.


### Core Module

The core modules has a theme and networking module that can be used by the rest of the modules( and any other ).
These two modules are common and reusable across the app - for a bigger app we can also introduce a 
common module to host all common features.
